        <p>
          My journey started a long time ago. From a young age I was passionate
          about technology specially with internet. I started learning HTML
          during my college days. But couldn't continue because of the lack of a
          device. But eventually after building a pc for me, I dedicated my full
          time in learning more about web development. I know i have way to go
          and it's a never ending journey. I love learning new things.

          Free Code Camp was a great resource for me from the beginning.Their
          comprehensive lesson and long courses with lot of exercises and
          projects helped me advance in my study. Their resourcefulness and vast
          courses on various subjects, variety of teachers and teaching methods
          gave me a better understanding of technology specially in web
          development. I am ever grateful to them.
