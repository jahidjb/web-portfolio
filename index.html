        <p>
          My journey started a long time ago. From a young age I was passionate
          about technology specially with internet. I started learning HTML
          during my college days. But couldn't continue because of the lack of a
          device. But eventually after building a pc for me, I dedicated my full
          time in learning more about web development. I know i have way to go
          and it's a never ending journey. I love learning new things. "Never
          Stop Learning"
